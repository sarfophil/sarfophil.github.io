                <h3>Intro to Js</h3>
                <p>I was able to apply today's lesson. <code>filter,reduce,forEach and map</code> are the methods implemented
                to solve the lab. It's an interesting functionality ES6 introduced. These methods have some similarities to Java's <code>filter,reduce,map and forEach </code>
                 .
                Thank you.

                <h3>Movie Review Report</h3>
                <p>I was able to complete my movie review lab but it took me 1 hour 30 minutes to design some of the elements. Interesting css function like linear-gradient to create transition of two colors. Float and position was useful for positioning
                    elements on the page. Thank you</p>

                <h3>Responsive Design Exercise</h3>
                <p>I was able to complete the responsive website using the grid as well as the bootstrap. It took me about 1 hour for the grid and 35 mins for the bootstrap version. Bootstrap makes designing HTML easier and faster. The interesting idea is
                    to familiarize with the class names and their usages. Thank you
