  Dear Professor,
  It took me 1 hour to complete my lab.
        ES6 Block scope,Function borrowing,Closures and ES6 <code>for in & for of</code>
        interesting experience I had from this lab
        I integrated mocha junit testing library. It's very easy to use and provides feature to group unit testings.
        Thank you
